* `./profiles.py` provides the classes `plot_alongshore` and `plot_crossshore` for graphing profiles;
* `./spectrum.py` contains the classes `plot_spectrum_1d` and `plot_spectrum_2d` for computing and visulalising 1d and 2d power spectra;
* `./timeseries.py` provides the class `plot_timeseries` for visualising temporal variations.
