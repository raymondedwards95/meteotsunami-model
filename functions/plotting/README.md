# Plotting

This folder contains functions for visualising the results of the simulations.

* `./base.py` contains the base class `plot_base` containing common methods for all figures;
* `./alongshore.py` provides the class `plot_alongshore` for graphing along-shore profiles;
* `./contour.py` provides the class `plot_contour` for visualising spatial variations;
* `./crosshore.py` provides the class `plot_crossshore` for graphing cross-shore profiles;
* `./spectrum1d.py` contains the class `plot_spectrum_1d` for computing and visulalising 1d power spectra;
* `./spectrum2d.py` contains the class `plot_spectrum_2d` for computing and visulalising 2d power spectra;
* `./timeseries.py` provides the class `plot_timeseries` for visualising temporal variations.
